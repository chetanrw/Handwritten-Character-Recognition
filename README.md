Collect images of handwritten letters of one of the Indian languages.

Split the data into train and test tests (80% train and 20% test).

Use dimension reduction techniques, PCA and t-SNE to reduce the dimensions of the data.

Train a classification model using neural networks and support vector machines on the training data.
